# Coding Test Solution

This repository contains two distinct programs, each residing in its respective folder: `question_1` and `question_2`. These programs are written in C and are designed to solve different mathematical problems.
This README guide will help you navigate the project structure and provide instructions on building and running the programs.

## Development Environment

### Programming Language

All programs are written in C.

### Compiler

You need a C compiler to build and run this program. It is recommend using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compilation.

### Operating System

The programs are compatible with Unix, MacOs and Windows when using C compilers.

## Compilation

To compile the source code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files (`file_name.c`).

3. Use the following command to compile the code:

   ```shell
   gcc file_name.c -o file_name
   ```

4. Then run the file_name:
   ```shell
   ./file_name
   ```

## Online Compilation:

1. Open your web browser and visit the following link: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler

2. Copy and paste the code from any of the program files into the provided editor.

3. Click the "Run" or "Compile & Execute" button to compile and run the code in your browser

## Detailed Code Information (Question-Specific)

## Question 1

For a deeper understanding of the code and its thought process, refer to the README file within the question_1 folder.

## Question 2

Within the question_2 folder, you will find additional README files that provide in-depth insights into the code, including advantages and disadvantages. These READMEs offer a comprehensive understanding of each code's implementation and usage.
